A Hardhat-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile, run and test smart contracts
- [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain): generate TypeScript bindings for smart contracts
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/): renowned Ethereum library and wallet implementation
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): code linter
- [Solcover](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage): code coverage
- [Prettier Plugin Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity): code formatter

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an environment
variable. You can follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, you can use this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

> NOTE: Make sure to use Node 16.

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Run local

```sh
$ yarn hardhat node
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy
```

Deploy the contracts to live network (e.g. goerli):

```sh
$ yarn deploy --network goerli
```

### Verify on Etherscan

To verify on Etherscan, first get the implementation address via Etherscan:

- Under the contract tab select 'is this a Proxy?' and Etherscan will display the implementation address

Example for Goerli:

```sh
yarn hardhat --network goerli verify CONTRACT_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS
```

## Tips

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the [hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.

## Using GitPod

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an open-source developer platform for remote development.

To view the coverage report generated by `yarn coverage`, just click `Go Live` from the status bar to turn the server on/off.
